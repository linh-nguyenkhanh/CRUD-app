## Description:

### Technologies and tools used:

     * TailwindCSS
#### Back End
* Express
* Node
#### Database
* Postgres

#### Deploy Netlify
### App functionality overview:
- I do this Todo List project to learn about how to work with Postgres SQL database.Also, I learn more clearly about using ExpessJS with Node for the server-side and for the client-side, I practice smoothly using React hooks and components for creating, updating, reading and deleting todo task. 
- I have modified my project for my preference way of learning, try to avoid tutorial hell. 
- In the tutorial, instructor used "Passing Props to a Component" method, but I use createContext and useContext hooks, so contexts let components pass information without explicitly passing props. I use Tailwindcss for styling, instead of using Bootstraps as intructor used.
