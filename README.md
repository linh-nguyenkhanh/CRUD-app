# CRUD_project with PERN stack : 

#Link tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldYcgPKEZC8

I do this project to learn about how to work with Postgres SQL database.Also, I learn more clearly about using ExpessJS with Node for the server-side and for the client-side, I practice smoothly using React hooks and components. 

I have modified my project for my preference way of learning, try to avoid tutorial hell. 

In the tutorial, instructor used "Passing Props to a Component" in React, but I use createContext and useContext hooks. I use Tailwindcss for styling, instead of using Bootstraps as intructor used.
